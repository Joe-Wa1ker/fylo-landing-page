### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

- Work out scrolling issues on tablets - cannot reach the bottom on most.
- Couldn't meet the criteria for the error message styling, more work with pseudo selectors needed, also struggled with positioning error message relative.absolute positioning didn't work.
- I think I have become overly reliant on flexbox and using it so prolifically is causing some small issues, consider whether flex is really neccesary on future projects.
